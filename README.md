## Overview
    This Python script processes an **NP-complete Subset Sum Problem (SSP)**, which is encoded in a **DIMACS CNF format**, and transforms it into a **Network-Based Computation (NBC)** network. The script performs the following tasks:
        1. Reads the **DIMACS CNF file** which defines the SSP problem.
        2. Encodes the problem into binary representations and generates junction blocks.
        3. Assembles the NBC network from these junctions.
        4. Outputs the **unified NBC block** in a user-friendly symbolic format.

## Inputs
    DIMACS file: The script expects a SAT problem in the DIMACS CNF format.

    Example DIMACS file (3SAT_CNF.dimacs):

        c Sample 3-CNF over 3 variables and 2 clauses
        c Manually generated by Michelle Aluf-Medina
        c Boolean formula is: [[1,-2,3],[-1,2,3],[1,-2,-3]]
        c SATISFIABLE
        c
        p cnf 3 3
        1 -2 3 0
        -1 2 3 0
        1 -2 -3 0


## How to Run
    Prepare the DIMACS file: Create a file with the SAT problem in the DIMACS format (e.g., 3SAT_CNF.dimacs).
    Open a terminal and run the following command:
    python 3SAT_Python.py 3SAT_CNF.dimacs

## Output
    The results will be saved to a file named NBC_output.txt.

    Output file example:
        
        Problem: 3SAT
        Number of variables: 3
        Number of clauses: 3
        Clauses:
        1 -2 3 0
        -1 2 3 0
        1 -2 -3 0
